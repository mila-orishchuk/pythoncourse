### Homework:

[Task 1](https://github.com/mila-orishchuk/pythoncourse/blob/master/Lesson1/task1.py)

Run the python interpreter via the terminal. Get familiar with running python commands in the terminal, work with output, etc.

 

[Task 2](https://github.com/mila-orishchuk/pythoncourse/blob/master/Lesson1/task2.py)

Create a python program named “task2”, and use the built-in function `print` in it several times. Try to pass “sep”, “end” params and pass several parameters separated by commas. 

Also, provide a comment text above each print statement, mentioned above, with the expected output after execution of the particular print statement.

```
(Ex.
# ‘hello world’
print(“hello world”)
)
```

 

[Task 3](https://github.com/mila-orishchuk/pythoncourse/blob/master/Lesson1/task3.py)

Write a program, which has two print statements to print the following text (capital letters “O” and “H”, made from “#” symbols):
```
#########
#       #
#       #
#       #
#########

#       #
#       #
######### 
#       # 
#       #
```
Pay attention that usage of spaces is forbidden, as well as creating the whole result text string using “”” ”””, use ‘\n’ and ‘\t’ symbols instead.
