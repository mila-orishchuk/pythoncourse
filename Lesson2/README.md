### Homework:

[Task 1](https://github.com/mila-orishchuk/pythoncourse/blob/master/Lesson2/task1.py)

The greeting program.

Make a program that has your name and the current day of the week stored as separate variables and then prints a message like this:

     “Good day <name>! <day> is a perfect day to learn some python.”

Note that <name> and <day> are predefined variables in source code.

An additional bonus will be to use different string formatting methods for constructing result string.
 

[Task 2](https://github.com/mila-orishchuk/pythoncourse/blob/master/Lesson2/task2.py)

Manipulate strings.

Save your first and last name as separate variables, then use string concatenation to add them together with a white space in between and print a greeting.

[Task 3](https://github.com/mila-orishchuk/pythoncourse/blob/master/Lesson2/task3.py)
