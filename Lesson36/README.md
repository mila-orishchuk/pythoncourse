# Практика: створення чату

This is a practice lesson for building a simple chat application

    - [A basic client to server chat in the console. We will need to create two files, one server, and one client.]
    - [The clients will send messages to the server and the server will then broadcast them to all the connected clients.]
    - [Users (clients) will be able to rename themselves in the server, so that other clients don’t see client1,client2 etc,
    but the user’s name instead.]
